        <p>While design by nature is a prescriptive process where a solid line is drawn between designer and user, graffiti artists take control by shaping the designed world around them. <i>Graffiti picks up where designers left off.</i> The presence of graffiti can fundamentally change the way people interact with a space, and because of this, graffiti can be as important as the originally designed environment. This is currently understood as a problem that must be corrected, thus the prohibition of graffiti. In doing so, the line drawn between designer and user becomes ever bolder, and the designer is further privileged over the user. In addition to providing graffiti data, <i>“NYC Graffiti” questions the user/designer hierarchy by placing creative user participation at the core of its functionality.</i> </p>
        <p>This website’s bare structure parallels a bland wall in an urban environment in a digital context, but while a generic building in a city tries to prevent vandalism, “NYC Graffiti” cannot function without it. Every click on the homepage creates a pixelated spot of spray paint, allowing users to draw on the page to populate the blank space and breathe life into the design. Each mark correlates with a random report of graffiti in New York City pulled from the NYC Open Data Graffiti Tracking API, which does two things: it places the digital marks made in direct conversation with graffiti in real life, and it stakes the display of the data on user participation.</p>
        <p>The connection between user interaction on “NYC Graffiti” and real graffiti in New York City questions the prohibition of user participation in urban spaces as well as digital. This correlation also proposes a new model of designer-user relationship that actively empowers the user in their interactions with the design. The user can choose how to visualize the data in this website, and due to the element of randomness, each collection of data pulled will be unique. This self-direction and individuality of experience achieved by this simple interaction can be explored in other spaces and disciplines of design. By breaking down the user-designer hierarchy, <i>users become collaborators in design</i> and develop a greater stake in and connection to their environments, whether they be digital or physical.</p>
